                <h2>2.Dragon Ball</h2>
                In the Dragon Ball: Adventure Special, the Dragon Ball manga author, Akira Toriyama, explains that there are seven Dragon Balls because there are eight balls in Hakken-Den, a famous Edo-era Japanese novel, and that he would have hated for them to be exactly the same number, so he had the amount of Dragon Balls be changed to seven in number.
                Unlike other forms of fiction that involve wishes, the Dragon Balls grant a wish exactly as the wisher imagined it, rather than warping the wish so that it is technically granted but ends up making the wisher's life even more difficult. For example, when King Piccolo wished for youth, he was not reduced to an infant, but rather, returned to his prime when he was at his strongest. Also, when a victim is revived from the dead, they are not undead, but are truly returned to life.
